4M - MULTI-MEDIA MARKETING MENU

Originally, I was just playing aroung with the Appium library to automate phone gestures. I then started testing it out on Android Studio emulators. At that point, I had a very messy directory and doing work became quite a challenge. I decided to make it an official project with a professional looking GUI and a clean project structure with clean class files. Currently, I am making this project open source for anyone to view and download.  It is not finished by any means and still has quite a bit of work ahead to complete it. For the time being, I am only developing the Snapchat menus and will likely come back to other platforms later on. At some point I may no longer wish to make it open source simply because the software can be dangerous if in the wrong hands.

This project was developed with java and uses Appium/Selenium libraries for phone automation and Swing for the GUI.
